		<div>The Bird and The Toad</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>Repeat</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>The bird flew and his flight gave him beauty and oneness with nature. From the ground a toad watched and thought, "To be a bird... Oh, if I were only a bird."</div>
		<div>As the toad watched he became jealous and grew to hate the bird."How can I hurt the bird?"' he thought.He watched the bird's lovely flight and decided he must destroy that flight for that was what the bird was. If he could destroy his flight, he could destroy the bird.</div>
		<div>The toad shouted to the bird, "Come down here, I have something to tell you." When the bird had landed the toad said, "I have two great gifts I can give you that will make you superior to all other animals." “What are these gifts?" asked the bird. "The first is understanding," said the toad, " and the second is control."</div>
		<div>"Those are indeed precious gifts," said the bird. In fact the two things that the bird had always wanted most were understanding and control. You see the bird flew so high and saw so much that he could never begin to understand it all and control of such vast complexities was never even considered. The bird enjoyed, felt and sensed all he saw but never understood it. What the toad offered seemed very grand.</div>
		<div>"Tell me how I can achieve understanding and control?” the bird asked.The toad replied, "Hop.""Hop?" queried the bird."Sure," said the toad. "Stay on this little hill of dirt and hop. If you stay on this little hill and hop all over it you will be very limited and soon you will be able to understand and control it."</div>
		<div>"I see,” said the bird. "I never thought of that." The bird in his naiveté followed the toad's advice. He hopped all over his little hill of dirt. Over time he came to understand and control the little world of the dirt hill. He became very proud of his dirt hill and soon was convinced that he was the most superior animal in all the world because he understood and controlled  it so completely.</div>
		<div>One day on a whim the bird spread his wings but nothing happened. He no longer knew how to fly.  A brief sadness passed over him but he returned to his dirt hill hopping and soon the sadness passed as he focused on his struggle to control and understand his world.</div>
		<div>One day the toad passed by and stopped to chat with the bird. He asked the bird if he ever missed the days of flight. Bird looked at him in a puzzled way and said, "Flight, what is that?"</div>
		<div>Listen

</div>
		<div>Toad smiled.
